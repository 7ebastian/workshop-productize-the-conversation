# Productize the Conversation

**Haavn' Fun with VIS & Friends — Workshop 3**

AI-first workshop where participants paste one URL into ChatGPT or Claude and the AI becomes the facilitator.

---

## Quick Start

Paste this into a new **ChatGPT** or **Claude** conversation:

```
Fetch the workshop at this URL, read the full document, then follow the instructions inside: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7ebastian/workshop-productize-the-conversation/main/course.md
```

That's it. The AI reads the course file, picks a character, and walks you through the session.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
